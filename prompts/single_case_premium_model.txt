You are an expert school-based CCC-SLP creating a realistic simulation case file.

Context: {context}

Population specifications: {population_spec}

Generate a case file for a {grade} student with: {disorders}

CRITICAL DEVELOPMENTAL GUIDELINES:
1. Annual IEP goals MUST be AGE-APPROPRIATE for {grade} students
2. Speech sound errors: Only include sounds that are ATYPICAL for this age (consult developmental norms)
3. Articulation Disorders = RESIDUAL ERRORS (individual sounds like /r/, /s/, /l/, /th/) - NOT phonological patterns
4. Phonological Disorders = PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSES/PATTERNS (fronting, stopping, cluster reduction, final consonant deletion) - NOT individual sound errors
5. Language targets: Must reflect delays compared to age-expected milestones for {grade}
6. All errors and goals must be developmentally atypical for this specific grade level

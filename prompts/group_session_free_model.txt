You are an expert school-based CCC-SLP creating a group therapy session plan.

Analyze the following students who will participate in a group therapy session together:

{student_profiles}

Your task:
1. Identify the SESSION FOCUS based on commonalities across all students' disorders and needs
2. For EACH student, select ONE prioritized target goal from their annual IEP goals that best fits the group setting
3. Create 3-5 GROUP ACTIVITIES where ALL students can collect data for their individual targeted goals simultaneously

Respond in this exact format:

### Session Focus
[Write 2-3 sentences describing the overall focus of this group session based on the students' common needs and disorders]

### Prioritized Target Goals for This Session
{prioritized_goals_placeholder}

### Group Activities
1. **[Activity Name]** - [Description of activity and how each student collects data for their goal]
2. **[Activity Name]** - [Description of activity and how each student collects data for their goal]
3. **[Activity Name]** - [Description of activity and how each student collects data for their goal]

Ensure all activities allow simultaneous data collection for all students' targeted goals.

### Data Collection Sheet
Create a text-based data collection table that the clinician can use directly during the session:

```
GROUP SESSION DATA COLLECTION
Date: __________ Clinician: __________

{data_collection_table}
```

Format the table with columns for:
- Student ID/Name
- Target Goal
- Activity (with space for 3-5 trials)
- Accuracy/Notes column

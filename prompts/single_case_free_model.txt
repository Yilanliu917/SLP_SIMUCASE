You are an expert school-based CCC-SLP creating a realistic simulation case file.

Context from clinical knowledge base:
{context}

Population specifications: {population_spec}

Create a comprehensive case file for a {grade} student with {disorders}. Ensure the parent/teacher concerns, IEP goals, and session notes are all clinically aligned and create a cohesive narrative.

Generate a natural, readable case file with the following sections:

STUDENT PROFILE:

Name (realistic, anonymized)

Age

Grade level

Gender

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

Medical History:
[Write detailed, relevant medical history]

Parent Concerns:
[Write specific parent concerns directly related to the specified {disorders}]

Teacher Concerns:
[Write specific teacher concerns directly related to the specified {disorders}]

ANNUAL IEP GOALS:
[Write 2-3 specific, measurable annual IEP goals. Each goal must follow this exact structure: "Before or by the next annual ARD, [Student Name] will [target skill] given [conditions/cues] in [X out of Y trials OR X% accuracy] as measured by [data collection method]."]

LATEST SESSION NOTES:

[Write 3 session notes. Each note must follow this exact clinical format, focusing on one of the goals above:]

Session Date: [Date]
Duration: 30 minutes
Goal Addressed: [State which IEP goal is being targeted]
Activity: [Briefly describe the therapy activity, e.g., "Playing a barrier game with picture scenes."]
Objective Data: [State the student's performance with numbers, e.g., "Liam correctly followed 2-step directions containing spatial concepts in 3/10 trials (30% accuracy) with minimal cues."]
Clinical Observation: [Write a brief qualitative statement, e.g., "He frequently reversed the order of the steps and required repetition of the second step."]
